# Property Assessment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze property assessment data across various modules to uncover trends and insights related to property values, tax rates, and other relevant metrics. The analysis spans multiple data points from the City of Boston's open datasets.

## Dataset
The project uses the FY2023 property assessment data provided by the City of Boston, which includes details on property values, tax rates, and more.

## Modules Overview
- **Module 1-6:** Each module addresses different aspects of the property assessment. For instance, Module 1 deals with initial data exploration and cleaning, while subsequent modules dive deeper into specific analyses like tax implications, high-value properties, and comparative assessments among different city regions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming Language:** Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis.
- **Tidyverse Package in R:** Employed for advanced data manipulation and visualization.
- **R Markdown:** Used to compile comprehensive reports that include both code and narrative analysis.

## Usage
Each module can be run independently, but they follow a sequence that builds upon the previous module's analysis. Load the project in RStudio and execute the scripts module by module.

## Key Findings
- **Property Value Distribution:** Analysis revealed a wide distribution of property values, with distinct clusters indicating different neighborhood profiles.
- **Geographic Impact on Taxes:** Geographic location significantly impacts property taxes and values, with waterfront properties showing higher value assessments.
- **Market Trends:** There is a clear trend of increasing property values over the years, indicating a robust real estate market in Boston.

## Visualization
The project includes a series of visualizations that provide insights into:
- **Distribution of Property Values:** Visualizes the range and distribution of property values across different districts.
- **Comparison of Tax Rates:** Highlights how tax rates vary across different areas of the city.
- **Trends Over Time:** Tracks the changes in property values within the city over recent years.
